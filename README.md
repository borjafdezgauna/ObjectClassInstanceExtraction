# Object Class Instance Extraction (OCIE)
(Borja FernÃ¡ndez-Gauna)

In this repository, I have put together some Nested-NER algorithms to compare their performance extracting object class instances from text.

So far, OCIE and CNN-Nested-NER work. I am working on Diffusion-NER and PIQN right now (both cloned and adapted from https://github.com/tricktreat).

The papers of these algorithms are in the 'papers' folder

## Running the code
### Requirements

It might work on a different environment, but I am using:
* Ubuntu 24
* Python
    * 3.12 (main version)
    * 3.8 (installed as alternative following https://linuxcapable.com/install-python-3-8-on-ubuntu-linux/)
* Visual Studio Code with these extensions:
    * Pylance v2025.4.1
    * Python v2025.4.1
    * Python Debugger v2025.6.0
    * Python Environments v0.3.10991008 (pre-release)

### Steps to run the experiments

Before trying to run any of the configurations, you should create a virtual environment for that folder.
Some of the algorithms use packages that require Python 3.12, others require 3.8. In each folder there is a installation.sh script to set up the environment. This will be activated by VSCode when we open the folder.

_In some of the scripts, the number of workers is hardcoded to 50. Set it lower if your machine has less cores._

1. Download and preprocess data

    The common/shared code is in the main folder. Open it from VS Code to run the initialization scripts:

    1. Download data from Zenodo (Run and debug -> Initialization: download data from Zenodo)
    2. Preprocess data (Run and debug -> Initialization: preprocess data (all))

    These two steps should download two data files and convert them to the different formats used by the different algorithms (in the folder 'data')

2. Run OCIE

    Create a virtual environment in OCIE following installation.sh and open the folder from VSCode
    
    1. Run "Convert Json files to Spacy"
    2. Run "Train all"
    3. Run "Evaluate all"

    It will take a lot of time. The results will be saved to 'data/ocie/results'.

3. Run CNN-Nested-NER

    Create a virtual environment in CNN-Nested-NER following installation.sh and open the folder from VSCode

    1. Run "Train : all"
    2. Run "Evaluate : all"

    It will take a lot of time. The results will be saved to 'data/cnn-nested-ner/results'.

4. Measure performance (from an object class/property perspective)

    Go back to the main folder, open it from VSCode

    1. Run "Measure performance (OCIE)"
    1. Run "Measure performance (CNN-Nested-NER)"

    The performance stats will be saved to 'data/ocie/stats-cvs', 'data/cnn-nested-ner/certificates', ...
